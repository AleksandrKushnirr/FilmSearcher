  This is my project that I did to demonstrate my skills for finding a job. Work on it continues, in the future there will be updates and publication in the Google Play Store.
  
  At the moment, the project consists of the following technology stack:
  - Kotlin 100%
  - Clean Architecture with Model-View-ViewModel
  - Android Jetpack
  - Networking: Retrofit 2, OkHttp3
  - DI: Dagger 2
  - Database: Room
  - Glide for image downloading 
  - Material Design 
  
  The application is able to download a list of movies from the Kinopoisk Unofficial API 2.0. The user can view information about each movie, add to the favorites list or share
the link to the movie in the messenger. To display suitable films, the user can filter by genre, country, release year, ratings or age limit.

In the development process, the ability to view the trailer from the application and the functionality of the reminder of the release of the specified movie.
